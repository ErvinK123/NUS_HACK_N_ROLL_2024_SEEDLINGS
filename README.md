- **Photo Analysis Enhancement with Google ML Kit:** In this innovative feature, users take a photo of their surroundings after answering the questions. The app then uses Google's ML Kit to recognize objects in the photo, providing an additional layer of analysis. This technology helps refine the personality categorization by incorporating environmental factors and personal preferences indicated by the user's immediate surroundings. It's a step towards a more holistic understanding of the user, blending their answers with visual cues from their life. <br/>
